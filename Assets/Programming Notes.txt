How to use a system:

Rules for running:
- Game Managers within scenes must be used for testing and then turned off. This is due to the GM in the "Splash" screen.
- Scoreboards must be turned on in scenes.
- "L!_Splash" is the first scene that should be opened and played to test game loop.

- Players
A Player Manager must be in the scene and is responsible for creating Players.
To quickly make adjustments to a Player - use the Menu Bar "Player Game Object" to add a (Player) prefab. Remember to remove this for the final game.

Tips:
- Type in "for" and double tap "Tab" to autocomplete

Notes:
- If the code is common between lots of different objects: use inheritance
- unique to each dif ob but use same funcs: use interfaces (inherit from multiple interfaces)

- Go to Skinned Mesh Renderer
- Shader -> MyShader/Cel
- Drag Texture for lighting
