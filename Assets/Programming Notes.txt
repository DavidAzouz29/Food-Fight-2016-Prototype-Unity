How to use a system:

- Players
A Player Manager must be in the scene and is responsible for creating Players.
To quickly make adjustments to a Player - use the Menu Bar "Player Game Object" to add a (Player) prefab. Remember to remove this for the final game.

Notes:
- If the code is common between lots of different objects: use inheritance
- unique to each dif ob but use same funcs: use interfaces (inherit from multiple interfaces)
